        <dl id="protext3">Embark on my academic journey from the first to the third year, where I've immersed myself in diverse projects. From creating Python games and number puzzles to experimenting with hydroponics, cultivating kangkong seeds is a semester-long endeavor. My Blender projects harmonize technology with Taylor Swift's 'You Belong With Me.' Join me in exploring the fusion of education and creativityâ€”a narrative of growth and discovery.</dl>

    			<dl id="protext2">Greetings! In my Programming 1 course during the 2022-2023 school year's first semester, I achieved a significant milestone. The project for the entire semester involved programming in Python, incorporating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to develop engaging and interactive games.</dl>
    			<dl id="protext2">For my project, I decided to create a number puzzle game. I chose this game because it's not only accessible to people of all ages, including children, but it also offers a great opportunity for players to develop critical thinking skills. This project allowed me to apply my programming knowledge to create a game that is both fun and educational, reinforcing the idea that learning can be enjoyable and intellectually stimulating. </dl>
    			<dl id="protext2">
    				By using Python and GUI, I successfully built an engaging game that serves as a testament to the power of programming in creating interactive and educational experiences.

	        	<dl id="protext2">In our Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education program, with a major in Information and Communications Technology (ICT), we explore agriculture, including hands-on hydroponics experiments. This course provides practical experience in sustainable agriculture techniques, enhancing our skills for the future.</dl>
	        	<dl id="protext2"> During my first year of college, in the second semester, I embarked on a fascinating journey of exploration. The project at hand was to nurture a hydroponic nutrient solution for an entire semester. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, I chose to use kangkong (water spinach) seeds as a prime example. After precisely 44 days, the results were remarkable. Kangkong, a fast-growing vegetable, flourished using simple do-it-yourself materials</dl>
	        	<dl id="protext2">This project not only showcased the potential of hydroponics for home gardening but also highlighted the versatility of hydroponic nutrient solutions, making it possible to grow various types of vegetables right in the comfort of your own small space. The experiment served as a valuable lesson on sustainable and efficient gardening practices for small-scale urban environments.</dl>

	        		In the 2022-2023 school year, during the second semester, I embarked on a creative project that involved using Blender, a 3D computer graphics software. My objective was to produce an animation, specifically a 2D animation, using Blender's Grease Pencil tool. The focus of my project was to recreate my interpretation of Taylor Swift's "You Belong with Me." This endeavor allowed me to explore and experiment with the capabilities of Blender's animation tools, resulting in a unique and personalized version of the song's visual narrative.
