					She has a commitment to her work, which is one of her attitudes that I have always observed. Her ability to be productive and open to learning new things is one of the qualities I adore about her. Her unique personality is largely attributed to her hard work and creativity in the academic realm. I'm glad she acknowledged her shortcomings and did her best to overcome them, as I observed her doing.
