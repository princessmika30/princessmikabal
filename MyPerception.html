        <dl id="title02">This narrative explores my personal beliefs and thoughts in addition to reflecting my observations of the real world. The story aims to both engage readers with its subject matter and provide advice on how to improve oneself.</dl>
		<dl id="title02">To begin with, technology is currently one of our necessities for us to communicate, move, and generate a large number of products that we require. However, what if technology does not require us in the near future? Many things that we have come to take for granted have been made possible by technological and scientific development.</dl>
		<dl id="title02">We all know that technologies like genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics (GNR) are designed to meet human needs and desires. It has several advantages, including the ability to cure diseases, facilitate improvements in transportation, and many more. It is beneficial, but it is also influential to the point that it may hurt an individual if an internal problem happens. Just as with technology, it can be extremely dangerous to an individual if it runs out of control due to the intricacy of its software For example, nowadays, instead of a lot of working students on any fast food such as Jollibee, robots are the workers in that job instead of a human, which is why there are a lot of unemployees and a lot of students who want to work, but it could be, just nowadays, but it seems that we are already abusing the use of technology. Human cloning research might also lead to humans becoming robots by uploading our consciousness to software. Because time will pass, it is a risk. Our scientists may construct robots that can act, communicate, make logical judgments, and think rationally like humans, resulting in human extinction.</dl>
		<dl id="title02">and when it comes to Artificial intelligence just like in the quote that " Artificial Intelligence is a tool not a threat" by Rodney Brooks. and it is true that the AI we use now is really useful for a variety of activities. That is not to say that technology is always positive; it is a tool that can be harmful if used intentionally or inappropriately. Despite this, it does not appear to represent an existential threat to humanity at this time.</dl>
		<dl id="title02">This overview talks about how in the end, our current actions and decisions will decide our future. Should we give these machines authority over our future? Should WE!, on the other hand, exert appropriate control over them? In our acts, we must be careful and vigilant. Remember that too much use excessively might be dangerous.a</dl>

        <dl id="title01">SEEDS</dl>
        <dl id="title02">I opened my TikTok app and scrolled the opening for a teacher, or, let's say, one of the famous and influential people in TikTok is a teacher, and you can learn super much from him. Like I said, no social media, no TikTok, no Facebook, no Instagram, but in the end, even though I have a lot of activities to do, 'it's on top of that. Is it just a break from a lot to do?</dl>
        <dl id="title02">So why do I choose seeds as the title of my journal? Well, because in the video I watched, Ma'am Aira is a new teacher, and I'm not sure how many years she has been in her field. But in the video I watched, she said that they're just raw rice that you haven't cooked like that yet; it's like in a profession that many of you aren't that good in the field you're treading, and I can call it seeds because, I'm really assured that we're still at the point of a seed, which is not yet sure if it will be planted, the plant will take a long time before it becomes rice and rice and rice can be cooked. And now we are still at the point where the seeds will probably be planted, but they are still in the process when we grow up in life, and I just want to share my experience lately, that I'm at the point in life where I'm really happy, I can pass on time, but I'm tired there, like sometimes I ask myself, 'is it still possible? ,and theres a lot of what if in my mind, if will still in this field, and using tiktok,ig, some of these social media apps, I use it as a sign to continue or to drop drop, and some of them are the type, even if it's just pure bullshit like, drop this sem, but for future engineers. I will continue. The simple thing is just like that even if I don't have an engineer boyfriend, it is a sign to me that you will continue, as Maam Aira Den said in one of her videos, "trust in the process"., Maybe now I'm having a hard time and the problems outside, but we are still here. Why should we give up? What have we started? We should take a risk. There is nothing wrong with gambling if it is for my future engineer (char engineer student with a tightening jaw, please; that's just missing pang inspiration lang po choz), so a little quote for today is "DON'T GIVE UP, trust the process, and even if we are seed, WE WILL GROW in the perfect time. Just wait a minute, mwuah.</dl>

        <dl id="title01">LIFE IS NOT COMPETITION</dl>
        <dl id="title02">the kind of amazing activity, but I was still able to use social media and TikTok.</dl>
        <dl id="title02">There's a part of me that's angry, and I don't want to compete with others, like even if I don't always want someone to come first in passing activities, there's still a part because there's a hatred in my heart like that. I did my best, but there's the other easy easy so that they can pass, and I'm on the point that I'm in the competition with a co-friend.</dl>
        <dl id="title02">To be clear, because I used to get used to it, I'm the one who gives the reviewer to them. Like before, when they report to others, I'm asking for their PowerPoint to be able to write, and then while the reporters who have been assigned are teaching together, I'm typing. I already have that document addition so that I can review it. Because I'm not really a pass learner who just reads and they can pass the exams, I need to listen to that, take down notes, also write over and over again, or do the reviewer so that I can just answer the exam. So that's it, and I'm just realizing that it's the one on the tip with Ma'am Aira again, like she read something in the comment and said that life is competition. It's actually long, but that is the shortline, and Cameron Taylor said that, as an example in the TikTok video I watched, "Life is not a competition with others; life is competition with yourself to do your personal best each day," and she also added that we have different opinions, and he respects that person's comment in her chatbox about life. and a big lesson for me is thiers wtill a part of mine that still angry to somebody that instead of thinking a negative side of my classmate why can i in the positive side, just ealier i see myself without angry with somebody like, even we are a lot of activities that we need to passed, still we can chikahan with other topic such as lovelife even we are still busy, some of us can have a lovelife (im loyal to my future engineer that why im still dont have bebe just kidding, Engineer Student nalang plz), so my point is  Maybe there's a part of me that is weak because they're growing and I'm still here, the others have grown up, me (still gorgeous, just lacking in height), like I'm still jealous not only in my personal life but in the other part, maybe it's right to say when in the quotes I always compare myself to others, why not everyday I just do my best and be content with myself, maybe it's not my turn now, like maam aira said</dl>
        <dl id="title02">"Wait for your turn. You're not late, you're not early, you're very much on time. TRUST THE PROCESS".</dl>
        <dl id="title02">and its a big lesson for me to be aware, instead of being negabels, that I also look at my positive, and not only should I look at others, I should be doing something with my goal to grow, and that's what's missing to me, that even if I say sometimes I try to exercise, do skin care (when there are a lot of activities, it's not fashionable to take a bath and sleep in a collage like what I experience just kinda), so maybe I should list the things I should do, take care myself (wag lang ang puso), think positive, don't negabels, and of course trust the process that someday (the beautiful princess Michelle's not just a beautiful but it's gorgeous just kinda). I'm not the only one who can get out of trouble; then there my friends and I will graduate together (not at the same time give birth early), we can achieve happiness together, and the hatred we have now, especially me, will also disappear. Life is not competition; we should just enjoy and do our best every single day of our lives, don't run, just wait for the perfect time, and trust in the Lord with all of our hearts. Believe in him, and he will guide us in the journey that we are treading.</dl>
        <dl id="title02">"Life is not a racing car; life is like a person who kind of wants to walk in the mood"</dl>

        <dl id="title02">GOODDAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY PEOPLEEEEEEEEEEEE IN THE UNIVERSEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, HAPPYYYYYYYYYYY NEWWWWWWWWW YEARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR !!!!!!!! </dl>
        <dl id="title02">NEW YEAR, NEW LIFE, NEW RESOLUTION(THAT DOESN'T WORK CHAR!) 2022 I have a lot of goals but the problem is just the first week of January I found laziness, on Monday I started exercising then the next exercise my plan is Thursday from 9 am since my class started, and that day is asynchronous so I have a lot of time to exercise and have energy but I see myself still sleeping, 12:05 pm I woke up but I went to bed early about 11:00 pm I just fell asleep then the next day I just saw myself sick with a fever, choking, I didn't go out to be infected with covid but bat I was plagued by laziness and I had a fever for no reason, I was just watching the sudden fever on top of the trend, now watching it is contagious but anyway there is still next week to exercise but next week? I have a full schedule now, we were only given the type of one week to be able to create a title and questionnaire that is also a bit of research, but I'm complaining about the complaint, even if it's just pancit canton, I contribute (charot) somehow I have a contribution for today, just meeting we are for the research to be done and then we just gave our possible titles then checking by Sir for the final title and  at least I have a contribution I was able to give a possible title and I am proud of myself somehow I have an improvement in research not just giving pancit canton I contribute a little knowledge your char btw I'm just wanna share my Christmas and new year experience well I'm glad I'll be on my own to complete the church night again, .. but the problem is I seem to have made a call center when I go to church at dawn the type I can sleep at 6am in the morning and wake up at 3pm in the afternoon (señorita ka dai ) so I'm used to mama's mouth, like a washing gun when my mom get angry and also on Christmas day I got used to it in 9am I have 1,000 in my wallet but last Christmas I didn't even have a peso, is that how it is when I grow up? , .. Even though my uncle was drunk, it was hard to scratch. He used to be drunk; he got 500 pesos for me now, but I forgot before I went to sleep. I wrote in a paper together with my wallet with empty money even bingchingko " ma, pa namamasko PO -salamatsueee in advance -from pinaka maganda niyong at pasaway niyong Anak mec2x " and in the morning my Tito that hindi ko nakupitan Nung lasing pa, he put 200 pesos on my wallet that, within that day for the reason that  I'm also exhausted because I'm going to attend the baptism on January 01, 2022, so I'll be my Godmother for the first time, and my uncle says its okay to be a Godmother rather than being a mother in young age in view of the fact that my classmate (in shs)/ my partner in crime is already 23 years old so it's okay to be at her age to be a mother nevertheless im still bless because for first im a godmother new year new day to experience  a new , and I don't have a job so they can have more godchild and I seem to be a Godmother, and in addition I can give a lot of blessings for me and hopefully be able to save for me (stop adding to cart in shopee sometimes i have trauma there are parcels arriving every day ).</dl>
        <dl id="title02">Nevertheless, whatever God plans for me this year, I will be proud and I will be happy because whatever he gives to me, there's a lot of reason, and it's a blessing (wag lang maging mother, please pwedeng boylet Muna Kasi mag 19 nako nbsb pa din bekenemen lord Kahit Yung poging sacristan lang yung kaibigan ng kapatid ko sa simbahan emz charot), so have a blessed new year to everyone, have a blessed 2022, and hopefully 2022, please have mercy on us (give me knowledge so that I can contribute to my groupmate charot), but hopefully 2022 is the best and a new year for all of us, and may the New Year bless us with health, wealth, and happiness. mwuahhh XOXO, Godbless</dl>

        <dl id="title01">SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY &  NATION BUILDING</dl>
        <dl id="title02">Science, technology, and nation-building are the study of how social, political, and cultural values influence technological innovation and also influence our society. so that science, technology, and nation-building are essential for our nation to be prosperous. and the Indigenous knowledge system, it is said that lessons we learn are intimately interwoven with their culture and the environment. Sharing my thought that "kwentong bayan na tinatapon na patay sa helping, paliparan even sa area"F"—the story about helping, Area F, and Even sa Paliparan is true, they also used to tell us grandpa that in that place it used to be that only the dead were thrown away, especially those who use illicit drugs, also mama said that they were also thrown away women were raped so, since thiers is no any light in night and no CCTV while in the helping (Somewhere in Paliparan I guess/not sure)  it took became a plantation now there it became fertilizer for the dead "that's just what he said told us that the dead are really being thrown there", another lesson in this topic is the role of Nation Building to give as shelter, a good Education, Provide security to those violent people, give us the basic services such as transfo like bus, airplane and etc. also that the DOST or Department of Science & Technology ahm one of thier outcome since 2017 to 2022 the second outcome or the result of STI reseacrh and activities where 380 only the researcher here in the philippines, there is still a lack of research to further develop our economy, and as a student we know that we are weak in research (nakakabonak talaga ang research lalo na puro pancit canton lang ang ambag chariz).</dl>
        <dl id="title02">but Of course we are not that good at research but as a Filipino people in this Beautiful country, we are not only beautiful and handsome we can contribute to this country, but other countries (Chinese) say that Filipinos are hardworking, they just really lack education, they are rich the philippines really lacks education that why as a student we know we ask for that kind of excellence especially in research but we are hardworking that i known someday will also contribute to society, and now since agriculture is also one of the things that our country is increasing which is also one of our subjects now using hydroponics its we can help mother nature also by producing more foods especially if they grow but one of our projects now in agriculture is we will interview the farmer and what we asked is that their livelihood is really at a loss, since the lands especially in the cape (since we did the interview) that after 2 to 3 years will be bought to become a village in bandanf imus pantaleon ? Since the ones similar to Green Gate, Gream Estate will fall apart if it used to be this one. The paddy fields before now are one of the villages, so they won't be surprised that theirs will also become villages and buy them since the government only pays them. As students, it's a big help to us to study them so that someone can contribute only to society. If the high positions back then were made, of course we as students would also have something to contribute to society, and using the knowledge from our subject agriculture even in our home, we/us can plan using hydroponics, and I hope someday I also have my own rooftop farm.</dl>

        <dl id="title02">" Technology is a useful servant but dangerous master" Christian Lous Lange,</dl>
        <dl id="title02">Yes Technology is help us is our daily needs, also so that necessity when it comes to producing easily a product, that as time goes on the number of people in the world is also increasing which is with the help of technology the creation of a product is faster, another info is that easily in Communication to our loves one abroad, and our friends we can't meet because of the pandemic, moreover when in our happiness, watching on social media technology gives us a hand also in technology also that we can research our needs such as tutorial in making a cake, and other nevertheless, of course, the technology also has a negative conflict such as instead of people working, robots or technology will work, that the number of unemployed is increasing, cybercrime, another info is on the movie i watch i forgot the title of the movie but its about technology as well,..in the movie, the man is rich, which almost all of his equipment is using technology even when turning off the lights or opening the door, just hear his voice or order him to turn on the light, the light will turn on automatically, but of course there is It's also a negative impact, and since he's alone, he doesn't have anyone at home, .. one time he went to a dental clinic which affected his speech, then he went home to their house is that he spoke out to the robot/ technology that is in their house which is open the door, is can't recognize his voice, then the neighbor will look at him is he looks crazy, just sharing that once you buy there make sure to look at the it will have a possible impact even if you say you are rich, it is not the inventor's fault to make your wants or needs in life easier, it is the fault of the person who bought the product why did that happen, another movie i watched, its not about the robot but connected in technology which is in the movie,.. The mother was a single mom, and his daughter was just a child, she had surgery on the side of the eye, which is connected to a device which is on the mother's tablet, that's what can be seen or if her daughter is there, she knows where to look, .. the one who has grown up the child, she went to a house with a dog and the dog barks at her and what the child sees is blurred or seems to be missing the channel, which is the devices placed in the child's brain is once she sees something bad or similar to barking ka or even sexual her eye are lublurred the in her mother side is that  red flag that means its a bad for her daughter (not sure) so what her mother was looking for was when she saw that the dog was barking at her daughter, while she watched for a long time as if something was wrong she seems to have wondered why that is happening, .. she observed her mother and only then did she find out that what she sees is also what his mother sees on the devices and you broke those devices in the end of yours movie also removed the device from her brain blesson learn for that technology help easier in our life indeed but too much of anything is bad, even its for your easier life, to see where your daughter but always remember your limitation </dl>

        <dl id="title01">INTELLECTUAL REVOLUTIONS THAT DEFINED SOCIETY</dl>
        <dl id="title02">The intellectual revolution pertains to the period of paradigm shifts or changes in scientific beliefs that have been widely embraced and accepted by the people, as well as the promotion of critical thinking and the creation of rules to ensure equal opportunities for all. Also here, we discuss Nicholas Copernican, who adopted the “heliocentric model,” in which the sun is the center of the solar system, while in Aristotle's model, he said that the earth is the center of the solar system, but still, the Copernicans are the real theory. Here intellectual Revolution is the discussion of the four cradles of early science that inform us about the science, technology, and some medicine that was made in the part of Mesoamerica, Asia, the Middle East, Africa Revolution,</dl>
        <dl id="title02">The first in Mesoamerica which is here that their main food here is Beans, corn, and Squash also the dogs here live with them which is they say that animals have their own life like humans, and Mesoamerica have 3 civilization part which is the first one are in Maya civilization that the famous pyramid at Chichen Itza Mexico can predict the Eclipse that wasn't just built in that part because there is a reason why the pyramid was built in that part which is situated at the location of the sun during the spring and equinoxes second is Inca civilization this civilization is about how they can grow their food which is the first use of irrigation third is third civilization is  that agriculture farming where land is divided into rectangle,that areas surrounded by canals where the water will flow so that it will grow quickly to be harvested,.. The second cradle of early science is Asian Civilization, which is divided into 2 countries, which are India and China. When it comes to tradition medicine in India, it uses Ayurveda, while the famous traditional medicine in China is Acupuncture, which uses thin needles through a person's skin at specific points. When it comes to technology that they discover in China, it is the compass, gunpowder, printing stools, etc. The third cradle of early science is the Middle East Revolution, which is about the Golden Age of Islam. In this century, Muslim scientists focused on science experimentation rather than plain experimentation. In this revolution, Ibn Sina was the first physician to conduct chemical trials. He also had a book of healing and the canon of medicine.</dl>
        <dl id="title02">So in this topic, I learn a lot that not only are the Europeans the good ones when it comes to the smart, but also the Indians, Africans, Middle East, and Asian countries are also considered to be one of the smartest, because before we just knew that only Europeans had already discovered they were the smart ones when it comes to science and math, but now that it has been studied, even other countries have contributed to our society, which has intelligence, especially in the subjects of math, agriculture, and medicine.</dl>

        <dl id="title01">Information Age</dl>
        <dl id="title02">The information age is essentially a transformation of traditional industries into a new period defined by computer use. This has been a huge stride forward in the economy, resulting in a continuous increase in all sectors by providing that procedures are quick, faster, more precise, and more efficient. Due to the obvious widespread usage of digitalized devices such as computers and smartphones, the information age is also known as the digital age. People millions of kilometers apart may converse and share information as if they were in the same room, thanks to the information age..</dl>
        <dl id="title02">In addition, before, it was difficult to get information since it was difficult to print newspapers. Also, before, it was written on every page of information that only a few got, but since technology has greatly improved, in today's life, it is easy to get information, some of that is just on our social media such as Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, and Twiter. Hence, it still has negative impacts since not all of the information we get on some social media is a fact. An example is that it's too corny, or I can say that it's been reported for a long time. like when in Jolibee one of its couple endorsements is Nadine Luster and James Reid who haven't been raw forever in Jollibee since the other couple they are Julia Barretto and Joshua Garcia since they are the last couple endorsement of it that there is no raw forever in Jollibee so an example of false information</dl>
        <dl id="title02">This overview discusses that Information Agee has a huge use for us, I believed that  it could be information age can define as Age of Economy since our economy is growing so the more we need the more we can improve the information or lay out the information not only the people with the field but as individual you can share your though or knowledge that you can't harm your fellow human beings, addition Information Age can be defines as Age of Entrepreneurship for the reason of fact that Yes there are many Inventors in our technology who make money from Information even fake the ones they publish well since you are one of watching them they still earn, Next is that Information Can refers to Age of Crimes As a result of many faked information about the transaction just like Kris (Artist) who delivered food to her even though she did not order so another miss information and not only is this situation some of the information is on dating apps that will show good or good people on the internet but in real life you will just be killed or some in the media is just rumored to have met up is to be raped and killed so another crimes for information lastly that Information Age can defines as Age of Chaos like in the last election many people are undicided since they don't know who the president believes since always every presidential candidates has negatives released by the media also in our some social media many people giving information bat they want this person to be a leader and so on. Nevertheless </dl>
